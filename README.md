# HW2: Stress Release Bubble Wrap KeyBoard
In this HW, a stress release keyboard is constructed using ReadBear Duo board, bubble wrap, and cupper wires. The text entry technique is first tested using switches mounted in a breadboard, once it was working well, a keyboard constructed in a relax bubble wrap material was implemented and tested. Enjoy and relax.
